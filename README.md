## 📋 What You'll Learn

- How to author and maintain GitHub Actions workflows
- How to consume existing workflows effectively
- How to create custom actions tailored to network engineering tasks
- How to manage GitHub Actions for enterprise environments
- Practical applications for network automation, monitoring, and deployments using AWS
