## 🏆 Project Overview - Welcome to the Court!

Welcome to the **NBA Network Automation Championship Arena** - where network engineering meets basketball excellence! This repository combines the power of GitHub Actions, AWS CloudFormation, and Python automation to create a slam-dunk infrastructure deployment pipeline. Just like a championship team needs coordination between players, our infrastructure needs seamless automation between different components.

### 🎯 Mission Statement

Transform network infrastructure deployment into a championship-winning playbook using:
- **GitHub Actions** as our coaching staff (orchestration)
- **CloudFormation** as our game strategy (infrastructure as code)
- **Python** as our star players (automation scripts)
- **AWS** as our home court (cloud platform)

## 📋 Prerequisites - Pre-Game Requirements

Before you can join the starting lineup, ensure you have:

### 🏀 Rookie Requirements
- AWS Account with appropriate IAM permissions (Team Owner access)
- GitHub Account with Actions enabled (Player registration)
- Python 3.8+ installed locally (Training equipment)
- AWS CLI configured with credentials (Team credentials)
- Git installed and configured (Communication system)

### 🌟 All-Star Requirements
- Basic understanding of:
  - CloudFormation templates (Playbook knowledge)
  - Python scripting (Player skills)
  - GitHub Actions workflows (Game strategies)
  - AWS networking concepts (Court awareness)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions - Team Practice

### 1. Draft Your Repository (Clone)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-network-automation.git
cd nba-network-automation
```

### 2. Set Up Your Training Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment (Team locker room)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows (Home court):
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux (Away games):
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (Get your gear)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Your Playbook (AWS Credentials)
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI (Team credentials)
aws configure

# Or set environment variables (Quick substitution)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 4. Set GitHub Secrets (Secure the Playbook)
Navigate to your repository settings and add:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your MVP access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your championship secret
- `AWS_REGION` - Your home court region (e.g., us-east-1)

## 🚀 Usage Examples - Game Time!

### 🏃 CloudFormation Deployment - Fast Break Play

#### Deploy VPC Infrastructure (Build the Arena)
```bash
# Using AWS CLI (Direct play)
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name nba-arena-vpc \
  --template-body file://cloudformation/vpc-template.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=TeamName,ParameterValue=Lakers

# Using Python script (Automated play)
python python-scripts/deploy_infrastructure.py --team-name Lakers --region us-east-1
```

#### Update Stack (Mid-game adjustments)
```bash
aws cloudformation update-stack \
  --stack-name nba-arena-vpc \
  --template-body file://cloudformation/vpc-template.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=TeamName,ParameterValue=Lakers
```

### 🐍 Python Script Usage - Star Player Moves

#### Deploy Full Infrastructure Suite (Championship Run)
```python
# deploy_infrastructure.py usage
python python-scripts/deploy_infrastructure.py \
  --team-name "Lakers" \
  --environment "playoffs" \
  --vpc-cidr "10.0.0.0/16" \
  --deploy-all
```

#### Validate Network Configuration (Referee Check)
```python
# validate_network.py usage
python python-scripts/validate_network.py \
  --stack-name nba-arena-vpc \
  --check-connectivity \
  --test-security-groups
```

#### Clean Up Resources (Post-game)
```python
# cleanup_resources.py usage
python python-scripts/cleanup_resources.py \
  --stack-name nba-arena-vpc \
  --confirm \
  --remove-all
```

## 🏆 GitHub Actions Workflows - Championship Strategies

### 1. **VPC Fast-Break Deployment** (`deploy-vpc.yml`)

```yaml
name: VPC Fast-Break Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'cloudformation/vpc-template.yaml'
