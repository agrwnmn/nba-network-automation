4. **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment pipeline

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed when:
- Changes are pushed to the `website/` directory
- The full infrastructure deployment workflow runs

Manual deployment:

# Deploy just the website content
./scripts/deploy-website.sh dev

# Or use the GitHub Action
gh workflow run deploy-with-website.yml \

```

## Data Structure
